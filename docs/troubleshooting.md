## LiPo Battery Connector Polarity (v10 only)

The LiPo battery connector on v10 ([DD-27675](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/27675)) of the Thing Plus - RP2350 is <b>reversed</b> from SparkFun's normal 2-pin JST battery connection. If you are using this board with a battery, follow the silkscreen markings on the board for correct polarity. This means v10 is <b>incompatible</b> with all single-cell LiPo batteries SparkFun carries.

The updated version, v11 ([WRL-25134](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25134)), fixes this issue.
