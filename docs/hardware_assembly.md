<!-- This section covers any assembly steps needed to complete the guide. Can be very simple but should include a simple assembly (Qwiic, USB, etc.) and a Soldered Assmebly section link to the PTH Soldering Tutorial-->

## Qwiic Assembly

Basic assembly of the Thing Plus - RP2350 just requires plugging the board in over USB-C to upload firmware and/or start programming with it. SparkFun offers a variety of Qwiic breakout boards with Python libraries like the [AS6212 Temperature Sensor Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18521) connected to the board in the photo below:

## Soldered Assembly

??? note "New to soldering?"
	If you have never soldered before or need a quick refresher, check out our [How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) guide.

Users looking to start prototyping with the Thing Plus plugged into a breadboard should solder a pair of [male](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116) or [stackable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15187) headers.
