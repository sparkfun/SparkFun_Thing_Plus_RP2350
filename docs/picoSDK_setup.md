### Thing Plus - RP2350 Board Definition

As of release, the Thing Plus - RP2350 does <i>not</i> have it's own board definition in the Pico SDK. Until this definition is added in what should be v2.1 of the SDK, users should select <b>Pico 2</b> for their board when uploading to the Thing Plus. We recommend using [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Pico SDK Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raspberry-pi.raspberry-pi-pico) in the meantime.
